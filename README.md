💤 SleepWise AI

SleepWise AI is an intelligent sleep pattern analysis web application built during the Intelihack Hackathon, where it secured 4th Prize 🏆.
The application helps students understand their sleep quality, predict burnout risk, and identify peak productivity hours using explainable AI logic.

🚀 Features

• 🧠 Sleep Quality Score (0–100)
   Quantifies sleep health based on sleep duration, stress, mood, and screen time.

• ⏰ Peak Productivity Hours
   Identifies optimal focus windows based on recovery and fatigue levels.

• 🔥 Predictive Burnout Analysis
   •  Burnout probability (%)
   •  Predictive burnout hours (how long focus is likely to last)

• 📊 Visual Analytics
   •  Radar (web) graph showing sleep, stress, mood, screen usage, and burnout balance

• 🤖 AI-Driven Suggestions
   Context-aware recommendations to improve sleep quality and reduce burnout.

• 🌱 Sustainability Focus
   Lightweight logic reduces computational cost while promoting mental well-being and long-term     productivity.

🛠 Tech Stack

• Frontend: HTML, CSS (Premium Dark UI), JavaScript
• Backend: Python, Flask
• Visualization: Chart.js
• AI Logic: Rule-based, explainable intelligence (no random values)

📊 How It Works 
SleepWise AI uses deterministic logic to ensure transparency:
• Sleep Quality Score
  • Increases with adequate sleep and positive mood
  • Decreases with high stress and excessive screen time
• Burnout Prediction
  • Estimates burnout probability
  • Calculates remaining productive hours before fatigue
  This makes the system interpretable, reliable, and suitable for real-world use.

🏆 Achievement
 • 🥉 4th Prize – Intelihack Hackathon
Built under time constraints with a focus on usability, impact, and sustainability.
